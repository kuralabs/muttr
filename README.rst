Mutter - PulseAudio Utilities and Helpers
=========================================

Mutter is a tool specially made for COVID-19 pandemic working from home people.

It allows to:

- Mute all sources (microphones) at the same time, in case the application is
  getting audio from a different source of the one you think its on.
- To mute independently of the application you're running (Slack, Zoom, Teams)
  because it mutes the sound server from the operating system (PulseAudio).
- To change between audio profiles, for example, to quickly change to your
  headset before a meeting, and then change back to your speakers to listen
  music.

Finally, it has support for a custom made hardware using an Arduino to mute and
change audio profiles.
